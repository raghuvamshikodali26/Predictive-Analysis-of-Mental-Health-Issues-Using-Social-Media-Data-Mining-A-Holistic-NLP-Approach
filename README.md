# Predictive-Analysis-of-Mental-Health-Issues-Using-Social-Media-Data-Mining-A-Holistic-NLP-Approach
- Mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and stress, are significant global challenges that often go undetected due to societal stigma and limited early detection mechanisms. Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have provided innovative solutions for detecting and classifying emotional states from text, offering a promising approach for early intervention in mental health. This project aims to leverage NLP techniques, specifically using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), to analyze social media data for emotion classification. The primary focus is to classify emotions such as Anger, Happiness, Joy, Neutral, and Sadness, as indicators of emotional distress that could relate to broader mental health conditions.
- We employ a dataset sourced from Kaggle, specifically designed for COVID-19-related NLP text classification, which contains a diverse range of textual data reflecting various emotions in response to the global pandemic. The model uses BERT for feature extraction and fine-tuning, making it capable of understanding the complex nature of human emotions conveyed through text. The model achieves a validation accuracy of 84.50%, with performance evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating robust emotion classification.
- The results of this study underline the potential of emotion detection from textual data as a tool for identifying mental health concerns, paving the way for more effective and automated systems that can monitor emotional well-being in real-time. The future work will focus on extending this model to detect more complex mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, thereby offering a scalable and proactive approach for mental health support systems.
